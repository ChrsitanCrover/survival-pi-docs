  <TabItem value="about" label="Description">
    The first mega base of the server. We started building it when the Nether Update was still fresh, so we got a lot of inspiration from these blocks. The base contains a fully automatic sorting system that sorts almost every item in the game. It also contains various farms and a villager hallways that are connected with it. You can get to the storage through a secret entrance next to the main staircase leading up from the mirror hall. The secret entrance is a one-block drop hidden beneth a retractable crafting table. The lever for it is behind the painting.

  <TabItem value="ncooords" label="Nether Directions">
    The base doesn't have a portal. But it's quiet easy to get there from Spawn. Simply follow the trail from the market, passing the furnace, to the entrance of the castle.
