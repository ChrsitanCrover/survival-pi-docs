## Lore and Tales

<Will soon be added>
  

## Build Process
-The original plan was for the base to only be the dome. However this was finished 2 years before the server ended so there was a change in plans. 
-The houses were built first in the city, then it became boring to make the same type of building, so more extravogant buildings were contstructed.
-Except for the dome which was designed in creative, all the buildings were created on the spot in survival.
