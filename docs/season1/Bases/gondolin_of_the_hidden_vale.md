  <TabItem value="about" label="Description">
  In the novel The Silmarillion (by J.R.R. Tolkien), a group of elves retreat to a hidden mountain valley and constructed the beautiful, white city of Gondolin on top of a small hill. This small city on the server is a small but accurate to the book recreation of that fictional city. The city teems with detail and life, including over 50+ decorated armor stands, several of them having names of the important elves in the novel.

## Lore and Tales

As the city comes directly from The Silmarillion, the lore comes from it as well. The high elves were the powerful force in their land for the longest time, but due to the enemy (Melkor) making incessant attacks on the elves with his abundant multitude of orcs, the might of the elves began to dwindle and they could hardly defend their lands. In an attempt to salvage some of the glory of the elves; Turgon, a prince of his people; along with his trusted elves Glorfindel, Ecthelion, and more; took his people into a hidden mountain valley revealed to him by the god Ulmo. There they constructed a pearl white city on a hill, safe from all evil. Eventually the city fell and was ransacked by orcs, but for years and years this city was a haven and a secret place for the high elves. Not long after its founding, a small city was built on the foothills of their mountains. This city was called the Kingdom of the Rising Sun, and althought the elves knew they were not dangerous, they always kept their presence a secret and kept an intent watch on the nearby humans.

## Build Process

- At first, the valley had irregular terrain and was covered in forest, so it needed to be deforested and leveled out. This process started on 08/27/2024.
- A schemtaic of the city was made in creative, so the materials were all gathered (besides quartz which I had to collect and buy way too many times) and the build was constructed with the help of litematica.
- The detailing of the city possibly took even longer, as 50+ unique and immersive armor stand characters were created, some of them being named as elves from the novel, and others being invisible yet holding up swords on the walls.
- The massive expanse of fields outside of the city had to all be planted by hand, which was probably the most tedious part, but after all that the city was finally done.
