    Simplest way to reach it is to get to the nether roof and go to the area around the coords (-1440, 750), which will take you to QuesiBoy's base. Then just follow the path to my base!

## Lore and Tales

Long ago there was harmony throughout all the lands of Survival-Pi and every nation coexisted peacefully. However, when word spread that Anubis would put an end to the world and the other nations began building a shrine to appease him, the residents of the peaceful Goat Empire and its neighbor nation the Flying Island decided to flee far away from all the chaos to avoid what they thought was imminent destruction. Their leader, the Goat Emperor erected a Castle on top of a hill to look out for any danger, and the rest of the citizens created a small, quiet village; completely gated off from the outside world. The city began to flourish as another nation, hearing of their success from the main land, decided to built a small city right next to it. The two cities believed they lived in solitude and peace, not knowing about the elves quietly watching them from the mountain nearby...

## Build Process

- The creation of this city began in November of 2023, when the first house (the mason's) was erected. It now stands next to a fountain in the center of the city.
- A few months in, work on the houses was paused as work begun on the castle on the hill.
- Much detail was put into the creation of the city. Houses would take weeks to construct, as detail was very much key to this city. Armor stands were occasionally dotted around the city to convey actual life in the build.
- The city was finished in June of 2024, right before the server shut down.
