# Official Modpack

We use and maintain a modpack for the server that adds some minimal quality-of-life features and includes a lot of performance mods to make the game run better. We mainly have this modpack to make the installation and updating of the [Proximity Voicechat](../vc.md), which we use extensively, a lot easier for everybody.

The modpack is not required to join the server but it is recommened to at least install the [Proximity Voicechat mod](pathname://https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) as we all use it.

## Installation

You can watch [this tutorial](pathname://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPwIr_54KVo) or follow the steps below.

1. Download the Modrinth launcher: https://modrinth.com/app
2. Launch the app and follow the instructions. (You don't need to sign in with a Modrinth account; you can skip that step).
3. Following the instructions, sign in with your Minecraft (Microsoft) account into the launcher.
4. Search for *SMP-Essentials* in the modpack search. Install it.

If you want to update the modpack simply click *Update* on the top-right of the Modpack screen. If you want to add your own mods to it, go into the modpack Options and scroll all the way to the bottom. There is an option called *Unlock*. The pack will remain linked, and you can still change versions. Only mods listed in the modpack will be modified on version changes.
