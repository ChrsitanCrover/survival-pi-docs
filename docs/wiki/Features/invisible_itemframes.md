# Invisible Itemframes

You can make itemframes invisible. Below are the commands that you can use. (The `/itf` command stands for *Itemframe*)

- `/itf toggle visibility`: This will toggle the visibility of the itemframe you're looking at.
- `/itf togglemode visibility`: Use this command to toggle the visibility of multieple itemframes. *RIGHT-Click* on the itemframes that you want to change. Run the command again to leave the toggle-mode.
