## Lore and Tales

Some lore. Who doesn't like to write some lore ðŸ˜ƒ *italic* **bold** __underline__. `Ever needed code too`?

### A smaller headline

#### An even smaller one

- A list
- more list

You can also add pictures anywhere in the lore. You may also add more sections if you see fit. It doesn't really matter. Your base, your post! ðŸ’ª

## Build Process

You can maybe describe how you build it. What you enjoyed most. You you just don't include this section add all or replace it with another. Your choice! ðŸ’¯

Of course you can also complement your descriptions with pictures of your progression.

## Additional Pictures

You cann add more pictures here if you have good ones. People love pictures! ðŸ¤©
