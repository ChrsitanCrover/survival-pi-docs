    ## Lore and Tales

    Some lore. Who doesn't like to write some lore ðŸ˜ƒ *italic* **bold** __underline__. `Ever needed code too`?

    ### A smaller headline

    #### An even smaller one

    - A list
    - more list

    You can also add pictures anywhere in the lore. You may also add more sections if you see fit. It doesn't really matter. Your base, your post! ðŸ’ª

    ## Build Process

    Maybe you can describe how you build it. What you enjoyed most. Or you just don't include this section at all or replace it with another. Your choice! ðŸ’¯ Of course you can also complement your descriptions with pictures of your progression if you want to.

    ## Additional Pictures

    You can add more pictures here if you have good ones. People love pictures! ðŸ¤©
